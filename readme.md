Summary

Task 1 Optimization problem

Module Pulp provide simple and fast functionalitie for optimization of liniar functions with resctirction. 
Main limitation of this methods is ability to process only liniar functions.


Task 2 Monte-Carlo integration

Method Monte-Carlo provide quite simple and fast way to aproximate calculation of integrals.
Precision of method straightly depends on amount of random probes.
